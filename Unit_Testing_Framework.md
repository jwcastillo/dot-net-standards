# Unit Testing Framework

## Nuget Packages

RECOMMENDED Library: xunit.net

We recommend xunit.net because it supports better test isolation, parallel
tests, improved assertions, and appears to be the standard for the new ASP.NET
Core.  It has broad support in CI systems.

Plugins are available for Visual Studio and Resharper to discover and run
Xunit.net tests.
