Versioning
===========================================

Any deployed projects should typically have a way to determine what version has been deployed. This section aims to set standards on how to display versioning information of your deployed project, and when/how to update it.

## Versioning Strategy

Projects will generally fall into 2 categories:

1. A project delivered to an end user that is on-demand, such as a website. These can be updated frequently or infrequently, however the update can be completely transparent to the user access it.

2. Web/C# APIs and Apps. The updates for these are typically visible (although they may be updated automatically in the background without the userâ€™s knowledge and explicit permission)

### Web Applications

Web applications, when deployed, should simply publish a build or release number and/or git hash of the version that was built. This could be something as simple as the date of the deployment read from a file on the file system or web.config.

This can be presented on the site hidden by an HTML code comment or a custom HTTP header, or if desired, built into the design (footer, or other place where version information would be displayed)

### Apps and Libraries

If you are publishing a desktop application, mobile application, or C# library, your project should abide by [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). 

*When creating APIs, see API Communication section for properly versioning a REST API*

## Versioning Documentation

When performing semantic versioning or API Endpoint versioning, your project should contain a Changelog. At a minimum, the changelog should be a simple markdown file that lists the following:

1. Each version released and, if possible, a link to either the CI build of that version, or the deployed artifact, or a web-based git browser with the release tag.

2. Underneath each version, list the following:

    1. A bullet for each change that occurred.

    2. If a change is associated with a JIRA or other issue tracker related issue, include the link to that issue.

This does not apply to Web Application versioning.

## When to Increment the version number

Version information should be incremented in anticipation of  a deployment. When the version information is incremented, the Changelog.md file should also be updated with change information (if a changelog is being published). If using gitflow, version numbers incremented and changelogs updated should only be performed on release branches. 

## Applying version and build metadata to the binaries

All .Net project files (.csproj) should build with assembly attribute metadata that defines the assembly version. This should be stored in /Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs. 

If multiple projects are used and if the projects have tight dependencies on each other, (e.g., <Proeject>.Web, <Project>.Core, <Project>.Data) a single version number should be used for all of them, such that management of the multiple version numbers across each project does not become a burden. In this case, the file should be placed in a directory that is hierarchically equivalent for each of the projects. This implies that if you increment the version for one project, you have to perform this in all of them. There are some tools we recommend for simplifying this process and keeping code DRY.

### MSBuild Community Tasks

There are several MSBuild extension tasks that you can include in your .csproj files that will allow this information to be automatically applied. This can be used in conjunction with continuous integration tools like Bamboo or TeamCity.

See [https://github.com/loresoft/msbuildtasks/](https://github.com/loresoft/msbuildtasks/) for nuget download information and additional documentation.

See [http://farm-fresh-code.blogspot.com/2015/03/convention-driven-automatic-release.html](http://farm-fresh-code.blogspot.com/2015/03/convention-driven-automatic-release.html) for an example of how to implement.

### AppVeyor

AppVeyor has a built in feature that can apply AssemblyInfo.cs transformations based on the build configuration file. If AppVeyor is being used for continuous integration, this is highly recommended, but MSBuild Community Tasks may still be used.

See [https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-configuration#assemblyinfo-patching](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-configuration#assemblyinfo-patching) for additional information.
