At this time, The Nerdery is not accepting pull requests from outside parties
for new standards. Our standards are not meant to be proscriptive for the entire
community.

If you catch a typo or grammatical mistake, we would be delighted to accept a PR
to fix it though. Likewise, feel free to raise an Issue in the Issue tracker

## Guidelines

* Remember that the standards are customer facing
* Try to keep line lengths under 80 characters
* Use `#` and `##` for headings, not the underline method
